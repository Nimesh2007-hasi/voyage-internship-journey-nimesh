ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This is my very first React application, built as part of my learning journey. The app demonstrates React basics such as:

Declaring variables

Using functions inside components

Rendering arrays and dynamic values with JSX

Displaying simple HTML elements

The app displays employee details like full name, age, country, favorite car, and languages.
